One idea is to prepare the dataframe including subsetting of columns, transformation of columns (e.g., rounding) before passing it on to the table function. That way we would only have to handle a single "flat" dataframe, rather than one with additional attributes. However, there are things that cannot be reflected in a dataframe, such as captions, footnotes, spanner column labels, grouping columns etc. So it does make sense to store both the original dataset and additional markup in a list.
